  <pre>Airbnb CLone with React Native.
- With this project, I created Airbnb Clone Mobile App.
- In this project, props, state and navigation structures were worked on.
- There is a navigation section at the bottom of the project's home screen and a search button that directs users to the screen where they would like to stay.
- After clicking the search button, it directs you to a screen called Select your destination. When the destination is selected, the guest is directed to the guest screen, asking how many people from which age group they want to stay.
- You can determine the number of guests who will stay with the plus or minus buttons on this screen where the number of guests is determined.
- After the number of guests is determined, you will be directed to the screen with suitable alternatives for you, showing the various features of the places to stay, using the search button at the bottom.
